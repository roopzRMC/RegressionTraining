When creating non linear models - you must remember the Model Flexibility vs Error graph - ie there comes a point at which the model overfits the data in the dataset and loses its prediction accuracy

```{r setup}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("EBImage")
library(EBImage)
```

```{r predictionimage}
img = readImage("prediction_accuracy.png")
display(img, method = "raster")

```
